This app was created in 3 days for the purposes of a job interview assessment.
The app provides a chessboard where the user can select the starting position of a knight and the position the user wants to reach.
The user can also select the size of the chess board (6 -16) and the number of moves that the knight can use to reach the final position.
All possible paths that do not exceed the given number of moves are shown.
If more than one paths use the same intermedite position, then only the fastest route is shown.
